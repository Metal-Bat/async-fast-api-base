# APP-BE-007 — Persist self profile and typed preferences

Backlog: APP-BE-007
Date: 2026-10-08
Area: users personal services

## Completion — 2026-10-08

Status: DONE. Result: VERIFIED_WITH_EXCEPTION. The complete thirteen-stage `mise run check` passed after D01 additive migration approval, D07 exact SDK exceptions and explicit approval of the ten exact non-secret baseline entries. The baseline update preserved all scanner rules and existing entries.

Observed commands, original failures, required service counts, tested source hash and private report are linked in [through-014-verification.md](../delivery/through-014-verification.md) and [through-014-gate.json](../delivery/through-014-gate.json). No required-profile test was skipped. This closes the backend task; later producers, frontend/browser acceptance and deployment retain their own task boundaries.

## Preparation history

The following original sections preserve earlier failures and pending-approval observations. Their PARTIAL/BLOCKED statements describe preparation and are superseded by the observed completion above.

## Summary

Self-only persisted appearance, locale and workspace settings plus editable names and owned private avatar bindings.

Implementation is prepared and real-service evidence is recorded. Completion remains
blocked until the final full gate passes; the proposed secret-baseline review has
not been approved. Do not interpret this record as DONE or strict readiness.

## Why

Wave four extends existing owners to meet the delivery backlog without duplicating
identity, authoring, execution, media or reporting infrastructure.

## What Changed

- users/domain/preferences*.py; users/application/preferences.py; users/presentation/personal.py
- Contracts C02; detailed behavior, defaults, compatibility, ownership,
  failure handling and peer instructions: `docs/delivery/wave-four-handoff.md`.
- Generated en/fa OpenAPI, inspector matrix, metric dictionary and metadata schema:
  `docs/delivery/wave-four/manifest.json`.

## Architecture

### Before

Existing application owners supplied the baseline behavior, with the gaps documented
in `docs/delivery/baseline-and-reuse.md`.

### After

Users-owned typed JSONB and avatar FK with history; live user locking serializes first writes and stale refs reject conflicts. Missing fields survive, null groups reset defaults, no-op preserves refs; avatar detachment preserves retained media.

### Reason

Keep authority and transaction boundaries with their existing owners; expose typed
bounded interfaces that normal editors can consume safely.

## Compatibility

Additive preferences migration on the owner-approved linear chain; preserves applied revisions. New self APIs and optional avatar binding are additive.
JSON remains BaseDTO snake_case with existing success/page/public-error envelopes.
No dependency/lock upgrade, deployment, shared-data reset or applied migration rewrite.
Frontend handoff is prepared; browser integration and owner acceptance remain separate.

## Validation

Commands and actual safe results are centralized in
`docs/delivery/wave-four-verification.md`, including failed intermediate attempts.

Result: PARTIAL — relevant database/worker/boundary tests passed, but the complete
quality gate is blocked by unapproved exact secret-scanner false positives. The two
SDK warning exceptions are separately owner-approved as VERIFIED_WITH_EXCEPTION;
this is not warning-free readiness.

## Backlog Impact

Enabled:

- APP-BE-016 (once the final gate permits completion)

Blocked:

- APP-BE-007: final gate and exact secret-baseline approval

Superseded:

- None

Conflicts:

- None; D01 additive policy and D07 exact SDK exceptions are owner-approved.

All unfinished APP tasks and their existing dependency edges were reviewed. No
later capability is marked complete by this implementation.
